### ðŸ“‚ Datasets Required
Each file expects a specific dataset to be present in the same directory as the script:
* eda.py â†’ goodreads.xlsx
* linear_regression.py â†’ advertising.csv
* logistic_regression.py â†’ Breast Cancer.csv
* decision_tree.py â†’ iris.csv
* random_forest.py â†’ insurance.csv
* k_means_clustering.py â†’ Mall_Customers.csv
* lda.py â†’ data.csv
* knn.py â†’ Ads.csv
* majorproject.py â†’ expected_ctc.csv
-----------------------------------------------------------------
### Common Workflow Across All Projects
1. Import required libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Handle missing values
4. Remove duplicates and outliers
5. Encode categorical variables
6. Normalize or scale numeric features
7. Split data into train and test sets
8. Train the model
9. Evaluate model performance
10. Visualize results
11. Save model
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* ROC Curve and AUC

Would you like me to make this version downloadable as a properly formatted `README.md` file (so you can directly add it to your folder or GitHub repo)?
